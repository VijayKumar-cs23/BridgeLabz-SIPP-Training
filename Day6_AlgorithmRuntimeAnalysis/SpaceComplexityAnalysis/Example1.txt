Example 1: O(1) - Constant Space

Code:
public class ConstantSpaceExample {
    public static int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Uses fixed memory
    }
}

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The function takes two integer inputs (a and b).
- It uses a single primitive operation (addition), and no extra data structures or memory is allocated.
- The return value is also a single integer, occupying constant space.
- No memory usage depends on input size.

âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.

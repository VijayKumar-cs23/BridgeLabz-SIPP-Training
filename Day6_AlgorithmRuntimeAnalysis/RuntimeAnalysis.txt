Question 1: What is Runtime Analysis?

Runtime analysis evaluates how an algorithm's performance (time and space) scales with input size. 
The goal is to determine the efficiency of an algorithm before actual implementation.

There are two primary aspects:
1. Time Complexity – How much time the algorithm takes as input size grows.
2. Space Complexity – How much extra memory the algorithm uses.

Runtime analysis is often expressed using Big-O notation to describe the upper bound of time or space required.

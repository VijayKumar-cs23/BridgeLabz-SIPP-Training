Question 3: Example 2 – O(N) - Linear Time

Code:
public class LinearTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.println(num);  // Executes N times
        }
    }
}

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Let N be the size of the array.
- The `for-each` loop runs once for each element in the array.
- The statement inside the loop (System.out.println) executes N times.
- No nested loops or recursive calls are present.

✅ Time Complexity: O(N)
As input size N increases, execution time increases proportionally.
